 ###  Difference between creams, ointments?
1. ointments have higher oil to water ratio (_about 80 percent_). you can find all formulation specifications [here](https://dermnetnz.org/topics/topical-formulations)
2. ointments provide a _protective layer_ over the skin and allows for trapping more moisture due to being more hygroscopic.
3. ointments are better suited for dry and scaly skin especially for conditions like psoriasis.
4. creams have higher levels of penetrations and more suited for conditions like eczema (unless the skin is **very** dry)
5. a general rule of thumb is to always choose creams unless the skin is dry (due to external factors) or if the disease require some sort of protective layer [some even petroleum jelly like Vaseline](https://healthopaedia.com/vaseline-for-psoriasis-a-comprehensive-guide-to-its-benefits/#:~:text=Vaseline%20is%20a%20petroleum-based%20jelly%20that%20has%20been,to%20prevent%20the%20skin%20from%20becoming%20even%20drier.)

### What about Gels and Lotions ?
1. unlike ointments and creams, Gels and lotions are mostly water based
2. Gels are aqueous or alcoholic monophasic semisolid emulsion, often based on cellulose and liquefies upon contact with skin. lotions are very light emulsions (that often need to be shaken before use)
3. Gels and lotions are often used to hydrate oily skin
4. Gels can have a plethora of other ingredients that make them posses various characteristics like [how PVP is added to provide hold in hair products](https://scienceoxygen.com/what-matter-is-hair-gel/) 

### The elusive nature of Serums
1. a serum in biological terms is protein-rich liquid which separates out when blood coagulates. serums in cosmetic products are different; they have varying ingredients and consistencies. it can be gel, oil, water or emulsion based.
2. they are formulated with high concentrations hence used in small quantities.
3. the choice of serum base greatly depends on its ingredients.
4. gel serums are often used to give a "lifting" effect to the skin. they're used in anti-aging and anti-wrinkle products
5. water-based serums are often used with highly hydrophilic ingredients. an example would be [The Ordinary Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% serum](https://theordinary.com/en-us/ascorbyl-glucoside-solution-12-vitamin-c-100405.html)
6. Getting down to the dermis is very challenging for any cosmetic ingredient, given the skin’s barrier function, but a blend of oil and water is best suited for achieving this impressive task. The emulsion will also deliver moisturizing properties to the skin, strengthening the barrier function.
7. oil based serums are the most common. they often consist of high-end specialized carrier oils that are fast-absorbing. they provide moisture and have lipophilic ingredients that can be absorbed by the dermis like sunflower seed oil found in [L'Oreal Extraordinary Oil Hair Serum](https://incidecoder.com/products/loreal-extraordinary-oil-hair-serum#:~:text=L%27Oreal%20Extraordinary%20Oil%20Hair%20Serum%20ingredients%20explained%3A%20Cyclopentasiloxane%2C,Flower%20Extract%2C%20Linum%20Usitatissimum%20Flower%20Extract%2C%20Tocopherol%2C%20BHT) 
8. oil based serums do NOT use preservatives which is a great plus

### serum or cream ?
1. **always** apply serums before creams 
2. serums are high quality delivery systems for ingredients like Retinol, vitamin C, hyaluronic acid [which is interesting on its own](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/326385) while creams 'mostly' provide more hydration alongside their therapeutic purposes.
3. serums are capable of containing more "fragile" ingredients that can be concocted in a very effective, highly absorbable  formulas that are much more potent as serums compared to their cream counterparts like vitamin C, Hyaluronic acid, BHA and AHA, Retinol among others.
4. serums are often more specialized

### WHAT THE F\*CK IS AN ESSENCE ???
ever heard of a [Toner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toner_(skin_care)) ? in the simplest form, a toner is a very lightweight water-based product used for providing a quick refresher through the day. that might be a bit of moisturizing or cleaning. you can think of it as a fancier way of washing your face :D
an example would be [BeesLine's amazing toner](https://shopbeesline.com/lb_en/whitening-facial-toner-5281018881675-8.html)

an essence is a product that is somewhere between a serum and a toner. it's lighter than serums and have higher concentrations than toners.
an example would be [L'OREAL REVITALIFT CRYSTAL MICRO-ESSENCE](https://www.tryandreview.com/en/skin-care/face-care/loreal-paris/product/revitalift-crystal-micro-essence)


### leave-in conditioner/cream and "leave-out ?" conditioner
1. let's demystify a few things first. it's actually called a "rinse-out" conditioner. also a leave-in conditioner can actually be a cream, a serum or a spray.
2. normal conditioners have chemicals such as trimethicone and dimethicone among others that might cause an allergic reaction to the scalp [among other complications](https://youprobablyneedahaircut.com/what-happens-if-you-dont-rinse-out-conditioner/#Should_You_Rinse_the_Conditioner_Out_of_Your_Hair) that's why it has to be rinsed.
3. leave-ins are formulated in a way that provide a lighter degree of moisturizing yet a safer and more long-lasting one which is particularly beneficial for those with dry, damaged, or unruly hair.
4. leave-ins are used in therapeutic manner more effectively (since they are "left-in" your hair) 
5. leave-ins can be used for styling too
6. both conditioners and leave-ins are mostly used to provide moisturizing and an overall healthy appearance for your hair after using a shampoo.

### what about oil replacement ?
after a thorough research I actually found out that oil replacement and leave-in products are actually very similar. the difference is mostly a marketing stunt as in "it's like oil but it's not greasy" but in reality both products have almost identical use cases, yet oil replacement tends to be lighter compared to leave in creams thus might be used more for "styling" compared to leave-in products.

### creams or oil-replacement ?
1. creams are mostly better for styling while oil-replacement are more nutritious.
2. oil-replacement are more suited for dry and damaged hair while creams are more suited for dense or frizzy hair
3. oil-replacement has a lighter texture

### the 4 horsemen of the shampoo apocalypse
##### sulfates:
1. sulfates are anionic surfactants that provide [deep cleansing effects](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4387693/) 
2. sulfates are the reason why your shampoo gives froth
3. most common sulfates used are [sodium lauryl sulfate](https://www.healthline.com/health/beauty-skin-care/what-is-sodium-lauryl-sulfate) and sodium laureth sulfate.
4. while SLS and other sulfates are good cleansers and oil removers they might be a bet heavy for individuals with:
	* dry or damaged hair
	* colored hair (it will remove the dye)
	* sensitive scalp
	* frizzy hair (because they create a negative charge)
5. on the other hand sulfates are considered good for individuals with oily scalps
 
##### parabens:
1. parabens are preservatives used in a plethora of products. 
2. although FDA doesn't disapprove parabens use, some researchers say that they are absorbed through the skin and metabolized to give an effect similar to estrogen which hypothetically could cause (in extreme cases) early puberty and gynecomastia. in reality though, it might cause acne for some people, yet in combination with existing health hazards like [microplastics consumption](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/news/20221028/microplastics-health-risks-what-do-we-really-know) it might actually be a bit significant
3. parabens are also linked to scalp irritations for many individuals.

##### silicone:
1. silicone is mostly used for trapping in moisture. they provide a barrier aroud the hair shaft .
2. the downside of using silicone is that it builds up on the hair eventually leading to locking OUT the moisture causing dry hair

##### NaCl
1. Sodium chloride is commonly used in shampoos as a thickener.
2. it can be harmful to your hair and scalp as it may cause dryness and itching of the scalp, hair loss, and affect the color of your hair. it is also considered an irritant and can cause burning or itching if it comes into contact with your eyes
